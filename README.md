# 📦 Amazon Sales Amount Predictor using MLP Regressor

A **Streamlit-based web application** that predicts the expected **sales amount** for Amazon orders using a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** regression model. The model is trained on historical e-commerce transaction data and incorporates categorical and numerical features such as category, fulfillment method, shipping details, and currency.

## ✅ Key Features

- 🔍 User-driven input form for key product/shipping parameters  
- 🧠 Trained `MLPRegressor` neural network for continuous prediction  
- ⚙️ Feature encoding (Label + One-Hot) and scaling pipeline  
- 📈 Model training and automatic persistence (`joblib`)  
- 🌐 Streamlit UI for browser-based prediction  
- 🧼 Preprocessed dataset (`cleaned_amazon_sales.csv`) with outliers removed
